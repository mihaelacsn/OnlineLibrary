                                    dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in 
                                    Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, 
                                    an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. 
                                    He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from 
                                    poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself 
                                    that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove 
                                    obstacles to the higher goals of 'extraordinary' men. Once the deed is done, 
                                    however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. 
                                    His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with 
                                    guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed.

                                sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. 
                                Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith 
                                that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression 
                                of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves 
                                into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality 
                                which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative 
                                approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition

                                target audience was the middle- and upper-class members of society—those who 
                                were more likely to be well educated—and it exposes the poverty existing in two 
                                prosperous cities: Paris and London. The first part is an account of living in 
                                near-extreme poverty and destitution in Paris and the experience of casual labour 
                                in restaurant kitchens. The second part is a travelogue of life on the road in and
                                around London from the tramp's perspective, with descriptions of the types of hostel 
                                accommodation available and some of the characters to be found living on the margins.</p>

                <p class="text">Is a 1942 philosophical essay by Albert Camus. Influenced by philosophers such 
                                as Søren Kierkegaard, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche, Camus introduces 
                                his philosophy of the absurd. The absurd lies in the juxtaposition between the fundamental 
                                human need to attribute meaning to life and the "unreasonable silence" of the universe in 
                                response. Camus claims that the realization of the absurd does not justify suicide, and 
                                instead requires "revolt". He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. In the 
                                final chapter, Camus compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a 
                                figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of 
                                pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again just as it nears the top. </p>

                                in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, 
                                back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided

                                and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared 
                                to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes." It is the story of a young man who,
