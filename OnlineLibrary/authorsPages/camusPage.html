            <p>Albert Camus (7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) - was a French philosopher, author, 
                dramatist, journalist, world federalist,[3] and political activist. He was the recipient
                of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44, the second-youngest recipient 
                in history. Camus's novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death,
                interest in Camus followed the rise (and diminution) of the New Left. Following the collapse 
                of the Soviet Union, interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced. He is remembered
                for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance, dialogue, and civil rights. 
                Known as absurdism, some consider Camus' work to show him to be an existentialist, even though 
                he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.</p>
            <p>Camus' philosophy offers a way to navigate a seemingly meaningless world. By accepting the 
                absurd and living with defiance and passion, we can create our own meaning and find freedom 
                in the face of an indifferent universe.</p>
